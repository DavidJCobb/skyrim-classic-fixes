# skyrim-classic-fixes
A DLL that fixes engine-level bugs in Skyrim Classic.

This DLL depends on [the repo I use for my reverse-engineered findings](https://github.com/DavidJCobb/skyrim-classic-re).

SKSE source code and project files ("skse" and "common") are not included except where necessary in order to compile in C++17 or in newer versions of MSVC. SKSE licensing terms apply to the included files.

This mod is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 except as noted in other files (e.g. if I make a helper function CC0 or something, I'll chuck a comment in there to let you know).
